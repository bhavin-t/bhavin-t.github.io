hi! i'm bhavin. i live in london, and i've been in tech since since 2010. i've been a support engineer most of that time, and those roles have provided me with experience in a whole bunch of tech along the way.

the aim of this site is to document and showcase some of the things i'm currently working on (or, realistically, have started and then given up on)

i hope you enjoy!
